This is a modified / heavily stripped down version of the original Quake
game, based on the videos by Philip Buuck (http://handmadequake.org/)

A lot of files have been deleted / modified. If you wish to obtain a copy
of the original unmodified source code of the game, head over to 
https://github.com/id-Software/Quake 

I took up this project for entertainment / education and because of the series
started by Philip Buuck (thanks!). I highly recommend following his Youtube channel 
which covers this series well at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXgjH2-Mrb3-h1_iWurz7dQ

The idea is to build Quake from scratch and have a fully functional Windows version.
The tools I am planning to use are -

Visual Studio 2013
Microsoft Windows 7

To download a copy of the game, check out Steam, they are currently selling the
game for only $2.49 on the website as of 2 Jan 2016 - http://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/
You will need the complete version for the data files (not part of their Github resource)

I do recommend buying a copy and supporting Id Software.

Notes:
1. Quake was written in C and parts in assembler.
2. This version will strip out the assembly code to avoid uneeded complexity. Quake was written 
keeping a 486 in mind. Modern computers will do just fine without the Assembly optimizations.
